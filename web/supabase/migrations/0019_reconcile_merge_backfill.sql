-- Greploop fix for issue #10: a backfill re-run (late buffered taps arriving
-- after the nightly reconcile) must WIDEN the existing record's window, not
-- overwrite it with a partial collapse. Merge the already-written record into
-- the collapse itself so status is recomputed on the full merged window; the
-- ON CONFLICT branch then safely replaces with the merged values.
